1Refers to a request for USCIS to consider deferred removal action for an individual based on guidelines described in the Secretary of Homeland Security's
"memorandum issued June 15, 2012."
Each request is considered on a case-by-case basis.
See http://www.uscis.gov/childhoodarrivals.
2The number of new requests accepted at a Lockbox during the reporting period.
3The number of requests rejected at a Lockbox during the reporting period.
4The number of requests that were received at a Lockbox during the reporting period.
5The number of requests accepted per day at a Lockbox as of the end of the reporting period. Also note the average accepted per day for initial plus renewal will not
equal the total average.
6The number of new requests received and entered into a case-tracking system during the reporting period.
7The number of requests approved during the reporting period.
"8The number of requests that were denied, terminated, or withdrawn during the reporting period."
9The number of requests awaiting a decision as of the end of the reporting period.
NOTE: 1) Some requests approved or denied may have been received in previous reporting periods.
2) The report reflects the most up-to-date estimate available at the time the report is generated.
"3) USCIS previously discovered that the query code used to generate this report had some flaws affecting the data in the “Pending” fields, such that the data in"
"this field was over inclusive because it included cases that were not pending (e.g., cases that had been administratively closed or withdrawn). USCIS believes that it"
has corrected this issue in the query code and that this report provides a more accurate reflection of pending cases. Note that if this report is compared to versions
"prior to the March 31, 2018 version that USCIS has published on its website, the prior versions reflect over inclusive data in the “Pending” fields."
4) The Quarterly Report totals may not match the totals provided within the Demographics Reports due to differences in how the data is generated.
"5) USCIS previously discovered that the query code used to generate this report had some flaws affecting the data in the “Approved” and ""Denied"" fields, such"
that the data in this field was under reported because it did not include certain history action codes that are counted as approvals or denials. USCIS believes that it
has corrected this issue in the query code and that this report provides a more accurate reflection of approved and denied cases. Note that if this report is compared
"to versions prior to the March 31, 2019 version that USCIS has published on its website, the prior versions reflect under reported data in the “Approved” and ""Denied"""
"fields. The increase in the ""Approved"" and ""Denied"" counts has decreased the ""Pending"" counts."
